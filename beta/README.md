# Liquibase Data Open Beta Program

Thank you for joining Liquibase Open Beta Program.

We are investigating how Liquibase can help provide versioned databases. We believe that versioning data and database structure via containers will help our users provide valid test databases to other team members. Git users will find that our commands are familiar and align with core git functionality such as `commit`, `push`, and `pull`. There are many other commands we believe you will find useful.

You can always chat with Liquibasers on Discord: https://discord.gg/NVpqM7nNnT. If you are having ANY issues with the Beta Program, simply ask your questions in #beta-releases.

We have broken the Beta Program into three one-hour sessions. After completing a session, please provide feedback via the links below.
